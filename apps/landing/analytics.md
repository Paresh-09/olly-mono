# Complete User Journey Tracking Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to implement comprehensive user journey tracking in your application, from anonymous visitors through signup/login and beyond.

## 1. Setup User Journey Core Components

First, ensure your core `UserJourney` utility is properly implemented with all the necessary methods. This should be the foundation of your tracking system.

## 2. Track Anonymous Visitors

Place the `AnonymousTracker` component in your root layout to track all anonymous visitors:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import AnonymousTracker from '@/components/analytics/AnonymousTracker';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* Track anonymous visitors */}
        <AnonymousTracker />
        
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## 3. Update Signup/Login Forms

Replace your existing form handling code with the enhanced versions that include tracking. The primary changes are:

- Add event tracking for form interactions
- Track signup/login attempts
- Record conversions from anonymous to authenticated users
- Track errors and outcomes
- Maintain UTM parameters for attribution

## 4. Add Authentication Tracking to Server Actions

Modify your server-side authentication actions to support tracking IDs:

```tsx
// lib/actions.ts
export async function signup(prevState, formData) {
  // Your existing signup logic
  
  // Return user ID for tracking
  return {
    success: "Account created successfully",
    userId: newUser.id // Include this for tracking
  };
}

export async function login(prevState, formData) {
  // Your existing login logic
  
  // Return user ID for tracking
  return {
    success: "Logged in successfully",
    userId: user.id // Include this for tracking
  };
}
```

## 5. Setup Key Funnels in Mixpanel

Once implemented, set up these key funnels in Mixpanel:

1. **Signup Funnel**:
   - Anonymous Visit → Signup Page View → Signup Attempted → Signup Success

2. **Login Funnel**:
   - Anonymous Visit → Login Page View → Login Attempted → Login Success

3. **Extension Auth Funnel**:
   - Extension Login Page View → Login Attempted → Extension Authenticated

4. **Onboarding Funnel**:
   - Signup Success → Onboarding Started → Each step → Onboarding Completed

## 6. Create Useful Cohorts

Define these cohorts in Mixpanel:

1. **Converted Anonymous Users**: Users who started anonymous and converted
2. **Fast Signup Users**: Users who signed up within 5 minutes of first visit
3. **Extension Users**: Users who have authenticated the extension

## 7. Implement Key User Properties

Track these user properties to segment your analysis:

- Signup method (email, Google)
- Time from first visit to signup
- Number of sessions before signup
- UTM source, medium, campaign
- Device and browser information
- Extension status (installed, authenticated)

## 8. User Identification Best Practices

Follow these guidelines:

1. Always identify users when they authenticate
2. Use the same user ID across all touchpoints
3. Don't reset identity on logout (to maintain session continuity)
4. Track both client and server events when possible

## 9. Compliance and Privacy

Implement these privacy measures:

1. Add explicit tracking consent where needed
2. Don't track PII (emails, usernames) in event properties
3. Set appropriate data retention policies in Mixpanel
4. Implement a "do not track" option
5. Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance with deletion mechanisms

## 10. Common Journey Patterns

Look for these patterns in your data:

1. **Multiple Page Views → Signup**: Users exploring before committing
2. **Direct Signup**: Users with clear intent
3. **Abandoned Signups**: Users who began but didn't complete signup
4. **Returning Anonymous Users**: Visitors who come back before signing up

By analyzing these patterns, you can optimize your user acquisition and conversion funnels.
