## Introduction

Hey there! I'm Yash, the creator of Olly, and I'm thrilled to share our journey with you in intricate detail. From a simple idea born out of frustration to 700 paid users and counting, the Olly story is one of persistence, community, and constant evolution. Buckle up as we dive deep into the world of AI-powered social media engagement!

## The Problem: Boring, Repetitive Social Media Engagement

As a social media user, I found myself in a frustrating loop. I knew that commenting was the biggest hack for engagement on platforms like LinkedIn, but I was stuck. My replies were often just "Okay," "Great," or "Thank you." These comments didn't drive engagement or foster meaningful connections.

I started using ChatGPT to generate more thoughtful comments, and I saw a significant increase in engagement on my posts. But there was a new problem: copying and pasting posts was a nightmare. It was time-consuming and disrupted my workflow.

## The Lightbulb Moment: A Chrome Extension for Social Media

That's when the idea struck me: what if there was a Chrome extension that could generate engaging comments right on social media websites? No more copying and pasting, just seamless, intelligent engagement.

## Building Olly: The Journey Begins

With the idea in mind, I got to work. I wanted to create a tool that would help users engage more meaningfully on social media without spending hours crafting the perfect comment for every post.

The development process was intense. I focused on creating an intuitive user interface, ensuring compatibility with various social media platforms, and fine-tuning the AI to generate relevant, engaging comments.

## Launch Day: #5 Product of the Day

On January 10, 2024, we launched Olly on Product Hunt. The response was overwhelming! We climbed the ranks and ended the day as the #5 Product of the Day. It was an incredible validation of our concept and a huge morale boost for our small team.

## Growing Pains: Bugs, Refunds, and Persistence

Like any new product, Olly had its share of growing pains. We faced bugs that led to some refunds, and there were even a few voices calling the idea "scummy." But we didn't give up.

I want to take a moment to appreciate the users who stuck with us through these early challenges. Your patience and feedback were invaluable in helping us improve Olly.

## The AppSumo Launch: A Game-Changer

Two months ago, we launched Olly on AppSumo. The response has been incredible. Users love the product, and the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. Here are a few highlights from our AppSumo users:

- "Olly is off to an excellent start for their product. Setup is super easy and straightforward." - Vasttee
- "Right from the first comment that Olly crafted, I knew I would be using it for all of my socials." - jazzyb9090
- "I recently tried out Olly, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the experience." - AppSumo User

## The Power of Community: Discord Love

Our Discord community has been a constant source of motivation and ideas. Here are a few messages that keep us going:

> "I just wanted to come in here to say @Yash you rock! thank you for adding Skoll to the list.. I just noticed now that its seems to working.. you have a user for life bro" - Mexican

> "OMG, I just activate Olly again today. It doesn't mess with messenger, It turns off when I click disable, It has more languages. It works great in Facebook now!! Looks like every bugs I found has been fixed! @Yash GREAT JOB" - Mannii

## Where We Are Today: 700 Paid Users and Growing
