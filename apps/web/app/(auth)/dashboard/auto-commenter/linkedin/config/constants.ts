      "Easily had the most craziest week. I recorded 2 full courses, posted every day across all channels, got bunch of hard to ship features out there, took live sessions. Spoke to my customers. Travelled. It's still not over. Would i do this for a full time job? Yes. Would i be happy doing it? Maybe. I have nothing against jobs, but i've never really understood and enjoyed most of the environments i've worked in. Ego. Politics. Job roles. Lack of vision. No love for customers. Transactional. Took a note of everything that made me quit my jobs, and trying to avoid having it here so we can call it home. We have no job roles at our company, we work multiple hats, we work late, we have fun, we ship. I am fortunate to have an opportunity to know everyone personally in my team. Would not want it any other way. Glad to have a great team running the show. Sending positive vibes for anyone reading this post! Ps: That said, we're looking for marketing and dev roles, if you know someone who would be a fit, please let us know on yash@explainx(dot)ai. #startups #bootstrapped",

      "Enhanced Radar is building AI for air traffic control. Co-founded by Eric Button and Kristian G., Enhanced Radar is using sensors & AI to help detect and prevent human error. This is the first step toward human-in-the-loop control automation. America leads the world in aviation, yet its systems are a patchwork of outdated technologies that move one billion passengers each year. At the same time, our country is facing an air traffic controller shortage: 9 out of 10 ATC facilities operate below the FAA's recommended staffing levels, and this crisis will persist well into the next decade. In the last month, they launched Yeager, the industry's state-of-the-art speech recognition model for understanding air traffic control audio. Yeager is capable of ~1% word error rate (WER) on real-world ATC audio, an 8x improvement over previous state of the art. It's installed today alongside their sensor hardware at several airports in a post-operational role. Congrats on the launch, Eric and Kristian!",
